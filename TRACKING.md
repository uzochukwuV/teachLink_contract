# TeachLink Contract Development Tracking

This document tracks items that are planned for future development. These items were previously marked as `TODO` or `FIXME` in the codebase and have been moved here for proper tracking and prioritization.

## High Priority
- **XDR Parsing (`horizon.service.ts`)**: Enhance the XDR parsing functionality in the indexer to support comprehensive event decoding for Soroban smart contracts.
- **Governance Module (`lib.rs`)**: Implement decentralized governance allowing token holders to vote on protocol upgrades, fee structures, and new chain support.

## Medium Priority
- **Testutils Dependencies**: Re-enable `notification_tests` and ensure the `testutils` dependencies function appropriately without linking issues.

## Low Priority
- **Automated Fuzz Testing Parsers (`test_generator.rs`)**: Finalize the parsing logic for inputs during fuzz testing to ensure appropriate types are passed to arbitrary functions.
